Vovici Response Rate Tool
=========================

This tool is designed to take data from the [Vovici survey system](http://vovici.com/) and separate it down into smaller subgroups to analyze those groups' response rates. It is also designed to query multiple surveys to allow for a single client's multiple projects to all be shown with the same tool.
